# Regression Analysis
**Regression Analysis** is a method to determine the relationship between a response variable and one or more predictor variables. <br/> The linear regression model is written down bellow. 
<br/> $y$ = $\beta_0$ + $\beta_1x_1$ + ... +  $\beta_nx_n$ + $e$. <br/><br/>
Some asumptions must be fulfilled in linear regression is (Montgomery et al., 2012): <br/>
1. The relationship between variabel response and predictor variable is linear
2. Non multicolinearity means no correlation between predictor variables
3. The errors are normally distrubuted
4. Homoscedasticity means the error term has constant variance
5. There is no autocorrelation between errors <br/>

After we get the linear regrresion model we can subtitute x values that we have to the model then maka a prediction for y value.  <br/><br/>
